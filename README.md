Activation_ReLU: Rectified Linear Unit activation function ⚡
Activation_Softmax: Softmax activation for multi-class classification 🎯
Activation_Softmax_Loss_CategoricalCrossentropy: Combined layer for efficient backpropagation 🚀



📉 Loss Function:
Loss_CategoricalCrossentropy: Implementation of cross-entropy loss for classification 🔥


⚙️ Optimizer:
Optimizer_Adam: Adam optimization algorithm with learning rate decay 📉


📊 Data Handling:
Uses nnfs package to generate spiral dataset 🌀
Includes visualization of the spiral data 📈




(1) 🧪 Run Testing


# Generate test data
X_test, y_test = spiral_data(samples=100, classes=3)

# Forward pass
dense1.forward(X_test)
activation1.forward(dense1.output)
dense2.forward(activation1.output)
loss = loss_activation.forward(dense2.output, y_test)

# Calculate metrics
predictions = np.argmax(loss_activation.output, axis=1)
if len(y_test.shape) == 2:
    y_test = np.argmax(y_test, axis=1)
accuracy = np.mean(predictions == y_test)

print(f'✅ Test Results:')
print(f'   Accuracy: {accuracy:.3f}')
print(f'   Loss: {loss:.3f}')



🔍 Interpretation
Accuracy close to training accuracy (98% vs 99%) indicates good generalization
Low loss value confirms model confidence in predictions
Minimal gap between train/test performance suggests no overfitting
